# ***My Personal Project***

##**Dungeons and Dragons Tracker with Character Creation**

**What will the application do?**

This application with have a multitude of applications all centering around dungeons and dragons.
There will be character creation and all aspects involving the tedious process of creation.
Including stat generation optimal class and race and equipment management.
There wil also be game statistics of monsters killed and comrades lost.
You will be able to track when the next game is and be able to start and stop games.

**Who will use it?**

Dungeons and Dragons has a wide range of users, and new players always joining.
I would like to build something that the returning players will enjoy, but also
have something that will make it easier for new players to get into the game.


**Why does this project interest you?**

I've been playing DnD for around two to three years and I currently have a game going on every week.
I have always loved this game, and have always gone into detail when it comes to character creation.
I have even started developing my own class.

#Phase 4: Task 3
If you had more time to work on the project, is there any refactoring that you would do to improve your design?
- If I had more time with my project I would start by renaming and redoing all of the names, order and descriptions
of all of the code. Since I didn't have much time to go back through the code often the names aren't very indicative of
what the code actually does and thus it would be confusing for someone else to look at. I would also change the order of
the code so that they are all within their own sections. Finally I would change the definitions so I don't have to read
the code in order to understand it
